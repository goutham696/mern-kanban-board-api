# MERN Stack Project: Collaborative Kanban Board API

This repository contains the foundational **Node.js/Express backend API** for a full-stack project management tool (Kanban Board), similar to a simplified Trello.

This project is a high-value demonstration of modern full-stack skills, including API design, database modeling, and decoupled service architecture.

## üöÄ Status: Phase 1 (Backend API & Data Layer)

The API is fully functional for all basic CRUD operations on tasks, using Express and an in-memory array for temporary data persistence.

**Next Steps (Phase 2):** MongoDB Integration using Mongoose and implementing User Authentication (JWT).

## üí° Key Features of the API

* **RESTful Endpoints:** Standard CRUD operations for task management.

* **Decoupled Architecture:** Designed to serve a separate React frontend.

* **Core Dependencies:** Express.js, CORS, body-parser.
